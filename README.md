# SpecSwin3D

SpecSwin3D is a deep learning framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) band reconstruction, spectral modeling, and band importance analysis. The project focuses on reconstructing full hyperspectral signatures from sparse spectral observations, with applications in remote sensing and Earth observation. This repository contains the original SpecSwin3D implementation (v1) used for early experiments on band selection, reconstruction, and visualization. The updated and extended model (SpecSwin3D v2) is provided separately as a packaged release in SpecSwin3D_v2.zip. SpecSwin3D v2 introduces significant upgrades in model design, training strategy, and evaluation methodology, with a focus on physically informed spectral modeling and improved reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, SpecSwin3D v2 incorporates a unified spectral regularization framework that combines multiple physically motivated constraints during training, including anchor consistency constraints that enforce agreement between reconstructed hyperspectral outputs and observed multispectral bands via sensor spectral response function (SRF) projection, PCA manifold constraints that restrict reconstructed spectra to a low-dimensional spectral subspace learned from training data to improve physical plausibility and robustness, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) loss that penalizes angular deviations between reconstructed and reference spectra to preserve spectral shape, and spectral smoothness regularization that encourages smooth transitions along the wavelength dimension and suppresses non-physical oscillations; all constraints are modular and can be enabled or disabled independently. In addition, SpecSwin3D v2 introduces Spectral Positional Embedding (SPE) to explicitly encode band-wise spectral ordering within transformer attention blocks, supporting both learned embeddings and continuous wavelength-based embeddings, enhancing long-range spectral dependency modeling and improving discrimination across spectrally distant bands. A cascade curriculum training strategy is adopted to progressively increase spectral reconstruction difficulty, where early stages emphasize easier or anchor spectral bands and later stages expand toward full-spectrum reconstruction, improving training stability and convergence behavior, while a no-cascade baseline is also supported for direct comparison. The evaluation protocol in SpecSwin3D v2 is further extended to include full-spectrum band-wise reconstruction metrics, confidence interval estimation for reconstruction accuracy, error analysis with respect to spectral distance, and attention map visualization for spectral interpretability. The raw hyperspectral dataset used in this project is from the AVIRIS mission (https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/). The processed dataset used for training and evaluation is not publicly available; for access, please contact the author: Tang Sui (tsui5@wisc.edu).
